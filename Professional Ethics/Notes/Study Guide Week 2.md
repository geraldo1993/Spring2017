## Immanuel Kant:

- Immanuel Kant was a German philosopher, one of the most influential thinkers in Western Civilization, who contributed to the areas of metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics.  His philosophical thoughts have had a lasting impact on almost every philosophical movement that came after him.
